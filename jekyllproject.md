# How to start a portfolio website with GitHub Pages and Jekyll

Starting your journey as a software engineer can be a daunting task to say the least.  One of the best places to start is building a portfolio website to showcase your skills to potential employers. Luckily, it is relatively easy to host a website regardless of your experience level with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/). GitHub allows for an easy way to host all your files for your website in a single place while also not requiring you to configure any servers. Jekyll takes these files hosted on your github repository and creates a simple static website that you can customize as much or as little as you would like. Please note that while it is not necessary to have prior knowledge with HTML, CSS, or Javascript it will certainly be a requirement if you plan on customizing your website beyond the generic theme Jekyll provides you with.

While I am not an expert at git or github I have learned the basics of git to start the project. Here are the steps I took. 

Your first step is to download [git](https://git-scm.com/)
