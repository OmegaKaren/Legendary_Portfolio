<p>Starting your journey as a software engineer can be a daunting task to say the least.  One of the best places to start is building a portfolio website to showcase your skills to potential employers. Luckily, it is relatively easy to host a website regardless of your experience level with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a>. GitHub allows for an easy way to host all your files for your website in a single place while also not requiring you to configure any servers. Jekyll takes these files hosted on your github repository and creates a simple static website that you can customize as much or as little as you would like. Please note that while it is not necessary to have prior knowledge with HTML, CSS, or Javascript it will certainly be a requirement if you plan on customizing your website</p>

<p>The first step for creating your website is to create a github account. Once you have created your GitHub account you have to create the repository to store all of your files and code in.</p>
