<p>Starting your journey as a software engineer can be a daunting task to say the least.  One of the best places to start is building a portfolio website to showcase your skills to potential employers. Luckily, it is relatively easy to host a website regardless of your experience level with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a>. GitHub allows for an easy way to host all your files for your website in a single place while also not requiring you to configure any servers. Jekyll takes these files hosted on your github repository and creates a simple static website that you can customize as much or as little as you would like</p>
