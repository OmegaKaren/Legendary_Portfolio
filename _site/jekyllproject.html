<p>Starting your journey as a software engineer can be a daunting task to say the least.  One of the best places to start is building a portfolio website to showcase your skills to potential employers. Luckily, it is relatively easy to host a website regardless of your experience level with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a>. GitHub allows for an easy way to host all your files for your website in a single place while also not requiring you to configure any servers. Jekyll takes these files hosted on your github repository and creates a simple static website that you can customize as much or as little as you would like. Please note that while it is not necessary to have prior knowledge with HTML, CSS, or Javascript it will certainly be a requirement if you plan on customizing your website beyond the generic theme Jekyll provides you with.</p>

<p>The first step for creating your website is to create a github account. Once you have created your GitHub account you have to create the repository to store all of your files and code in.</p>

<p>When creating your new repository, name it whatever you like (note: The repository name will be the name and url of your website unless you specifically create a custom URL)</p>

<p>Once you create your new repository, you will see this screen</p>

<p>A person like myself who has never experienced Github or using git for workflow management the process for starting can be quite confusing. Essentially, github is where you store all your files and git is the version control system used to manage all those files on your github. While I am not an expert at git or github I have learned the basics of git to start the project. Here are the steps I took.</p>

<p>Your first step is to download <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a></p>
